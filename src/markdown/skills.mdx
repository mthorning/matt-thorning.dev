# Skills

I thought it would be a good idea to list some of the technologies I use here although I don't want this page to just be a list of languages and frameworks! With that in mind, I will try to qualify the listed items with some sort of explanation of how I use them or links to code or blog posts.

## Languages

Although the only language I use for work is Javascript, I have dabbled in other languages in my spare time. Unfortunately, as I haven't needed to use them daily I have probably forgotten 90% of what I knew. I like to think that I could get that knowledge back reasonably quickly should I need to though!

<TitledSection title="JavaScript">
As stated above, this is the language I use daily for my job and therefore the one I know best.
