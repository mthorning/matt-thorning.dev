# Skills

I thought it would be a good idea to list some of the technologies I use here. Although I don't want this page to just be a list of languages and frameworks, so with that in mind, I will try to qualify the listed items with some sort of explanation of how I use them or links to code or blog posts I have written.

## Languages

Although the only language I use for work is Javascript, I have dabbled in other languages in my spare time. Unfortunately, as I haven't needed to use them daily I have probably forgotten 90% of what I knew. I like to think that I could get that knowledge back reasonably quickly should I need to though!

<TitledSection github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript" blogs="/blog?tag=javascript" title="JavaScript">
As stated above, this is the language I use daily for my job and therefore the one I know best. I've used JavaScript
