# Skills

I thought it would be a good idea to list some of the technologies I use here. Although I don't want this page to just be a list of languages and frameworks, so with that in mind, I will try to qualify the listed items with some sort of explanation of how I use them or links to code or blog posts I have written and limit the items here to just the ones which are significant to me.

## Languages

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiJavascript} title="JavaScript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript" blogs="/blog?tag=javascript" >
This is the language I have been using for the longest amount of time and therefore the one I know best. It's also the language which I have written the most blog posts about. In addition to building front-end applications, I have also written web servers and CLI tools with JavaScript.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiTypescript} title="Typescript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=typescript">After spending a decent amount of time writing TypeScript since working at Ometria, I now prefer it to JavaScript due to the improved developer experience and additional confidence it can provide when refactoring. I invested a fair amount of time in reading books and completing courses so that I now have a good grasp of how to make TypeScript's structural type system work well for me whilst coding.</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiRust} title="Rust" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust" blogs="/blog?tag=rust" >
I enjoyed learning Rust which was quite a steep learning curve coming from JavaScript. Aside from working my way through the official book I wrote a couple of CRUD APIs and a CLI tool for listing the currently installed packages in JavaScript repositories which I use pretty much every day.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiReason} title="Reason" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=reason" blogs="/blog?tag=reason" >
After learning Rust I found Reason which allowed me to write front-end applications in React with a language which is syntactically similar to JavaScript but with a solid type system. I enjoyed using it but the trade-off was that the additional complexity introduced through the need to bind to JavaScript modules did make development slower than writing in plain JavaScript. For this reason I can't see myself using it much in the future unless I end up using it in my day job.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiGo} title="Go" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=go">
I haven't spent a great deal of time with Go but so far I have built a Graphql server to serve the list of blog posts on this site and I am also currently writing a simple SSO server which will allow me to add authentication to any sites I build in the future through the use of JSON Web Tokens. For me, it is the best choice for writing web servers and I'm hoping to get more opportunities to use it in future.
</TitledSection>

## Frameworks
I'm going to use the term "frameworks" loosely here, basically I'm classing it as any tool I use with JavaScript to create applications.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiReact} title="React" blogs="/blog?tag=react">
This is the main framework I use in my day job. I do enjoy using it, more so since the release of hooks as they have allowed me to write much more functional code which I prefer to using classes. I've written several blog posts on it but I don't have that many examples in Github; I prefer to try other tools in my spare time as I use React all day at work, the only exception being this site.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiSvelte} title="Svelte" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=svelte">
Svelte is probably my favourite JavaScript framework, I use it with Sapper which provides routing and server-side rendering. Github has classed it as a language which is why I'm able to provide a link to some repositories above. If I had to create a website quickly I would definitely use Svelte.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiGatsby} title="Gatsby" github="https://github.com/mthorning/matt-thorning.dev">
Gatsby is a framework built around React. It's main party trick is that it has a data layer which you can query at build time with GraphQL to create pages dynamically. This site runs on Gatsby so I've included a link to the code in Github above. 
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiNodedotjs} title="Node" blogs="/blog?tag=backend&tag=javascript" github="https://github.com/mthorning/weather-report">
I've used Node for writing web servers and also for creating scripts which perform tasks such as cloning multiple repositories or scraping data from websites. I've included a link above to a project which sends me a weather report each night as an example.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={DiBackbone} title="Backbone">
No links for this one and Backbone isn't something I would like to go back to using when we now have the likes of React and Svelte but it was the main framework we used when I started my first developer job so I do have experience with it and therefore it's going on the list! I have also worked with Ampersand which is a framework that was built on top of Backbone. Again, not something I wish to return to but the experience is there.

## Additional
<TitledSection collapsible title ="Test Frameworks" github="https://github.com/mthorning/mattthorningphotography" blogs="/blog?tag=backend&tag=testing">
I've used Mocha, Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library and Cypress. My preference is to use Jest with React Testing Library for unit tests and Cypress for integration tests. I mainly write tests for the code I write at work although I have also written tests with Cypress for my photography website which can be viewed on Github (link above).

<TitledSection collapsible title="Production Environment" blogs="/blog?tag=linux&tag=tooling">
Professionally I have experience with Kubernetes, a number of AWS services, Concourse, Jenkins, and Gitlab Workflows. My own projects use Netlify, Vercel, Github Actions or (in their infancy) bash scripts. I usually use Docker with Docker Compose for serving applications and NGINX for proxying incoming requests to the correct ports for services. I also have some experience with Postgres, MongoDB and monitoring services like Grafana/Loki, Scalyr and Honeycomb.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible title="Development Environment" blogs="/blog?tag=linux&tag=tooling">
I've used Linux and Windows (with WSL2) for development in the past but I'm currently using a Macbook Pro for development, both at home and at work. I use Kitty, Zsh, Tmux, and Neovim which allows me complete control of the configuration of my environment and I enjoy writing extra tools to help improve my productivity wherever I can.
