# Skills

I thought it would be a good idea to list some of the technologies I use here. Although I don't want this page to just be a list of languages and frameworks, so with that in mind, I will try to qualify the listed items with some sort of explanation of how I use them or links to code or blog posts I have written and limit the items here to just the ones which are significant to me.

## Languages

Although the only language I use for work is Javascript, I have devloped with  other languages in my spare time. Unfortunately, as I haven't needed to use them daily I have probably forgotten a large proportion of what I once knew. I like to think that I could get that knowledge back reasonably quickly should I need to and I also find learning the concepts from other languages helps me write better JavaScript.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiJavascript} title="JavaScript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript" blogs="/blog?tag=javascript" >
As stated above, this is the language I use daily for my job and therefore the one I know best. It's also the language which I have written the most blog posts about. In addition to building frontend applications, I have also written web servers and executables with JavaScript.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiRust} title="Rust" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust" blogs="/blog?tag=rust" >
I enjoyed learning Rust which was quite a steep learning curve coming from JavaScript.Aside from working my way through the official book I wrote a CLI tool for listing the currently installed packages in JavaScript repos which I use pretty much every day and a couple of CRUD APIs.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiReason} title="Reason" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=reason" blogs="/blog?tag=reason" >
After learning Rust I found Reason which allowed me to write frontend applications in React with a language which is syntactically similar to JavaScript but with a solid type system. I enjoyed using it but the trade-off was that the additional complexity introduced through the need to bind to JavaScript modules did make development slower than writing in plain JavaScript. For this reason I can't see myself using it much in the future unlesss I end up using it in my day job.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiTypescript} title="Typescript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=typescript">
Typescript sits somewhere between JavaScript and Reason for me. I haven't used it extensively but I do use it in my [photography website](https://github.com/mthorning/mattthorningphotography) (which uses Svelte) where I found that being able to create interfaces to describe data structures for code completion really useful in modules which passed a lot of data around.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiGo} title="Go" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=go">
I haven't written much in Go at the moment but it's the language I am about to start focusing more on. I think it will be a useful addition to my skillset, it's easier to write than Rust and at times feels like a scripting language but gives the ability to create executables so I can easily create backend services and CLI tools. It also has a big community so finding solutions to problems is a lot easier.
</TitledSection>

## Frameworks
I'm going to use the term "frameworks" loosely here, basically I'm classing it as any tool I use with JavaScript to create applications.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiReact} title="React" blogs="/blog?tag=react">
This is the main framework I use in my day job. I do enjoy using it, more so since the release of hooks as they have allowed me to write much more functional code which I prefer to using classes. I've written several blog posts on it but I don't have that many examples in Github; I prefer to try other tools in my spare time as I use React all day at work, the only exeption being this site.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiSvelte} title="Svelte" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=svelte">
Svelte is probably my favourite JavaScript framework, I use it with Sapper which provides routing and server-side rendering. Github has classed it as a language which is why I'm able to provide a link to some repositories above. If I had to create a website quickly I would definitely use Svelte, conversely I haven't written any blog posts about it, I think this is because it feels so easy to use and their documentation is so well written that I fel like there isn't anything I can add that people would find useful.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiGatsby} title="Gatsby" github="https://github.com/mthorning/matt-thorning.dev">
Gatsby is a framework built around React. It's main party trick is that it has a data layer which you can query at build time with GraphQL to create pages dynamically. This site runs on Gatsby so I've included a link to the code in Github above. 
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiNodeDotJs} title="Node" blogs="/blog?tag=backend&tag=javascript" github="https://github.com/mthorning/weather-report">
I'm pretty sure most people who write JavaScript have used Node at some point, I almost didn't include it because I thought it would be implied but then decided to include it anyway. I've used Node for writing web servers and also for creating scripts which perform task such as cloning multiple repositories or scraping data from websites. I've included a link above to a project which sends me a weather report each night as an example.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={DiBackbone} title="Backbone">
No links for this one and Backbone isn't something I would like to go back to using when we now have the likes of React and Svelte but it was the main framework we used when I started my job so I do have experience with it and therefore it's going on the list!

## Additional
<TitledSection collapsible title ="Test Frameworks" github="https://github.com/mthorning/mattthorningphotography" blogs="/blog?tag=backend&tag=testing">
I've used Mocha, Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library and Cypress. My preference is to use Jest with React Testing Library for unit tests and Cypress for integration tests. I haven't written many tests for personal projects with the exception of my photography website which has Cypress tests (link above).
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible title="Production Environment" blogs="/blog?tag=linux&tag=tooling">
I use CI/CD tools for releasing my code. At work this is with Jenkins and Gilab Workflows, my own projects use Netlify, Github Actions or (in their infancy) bash scripts. I usually use Docker and Docker Compose for serving applications or for running JavaScript scripts as executables and NGINX for proxying incoming requests to the correct ports for services.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible title="Development Environment" blogs="/blog?tag=linux&tag=tooling">
I've used OSX and several Linux distibutions for development in the past but I'm currently using Windows with WSL2 both at home and at work. I use Zsh, tmux and Neovim unless I'm trying out a new language and want easy access to extensions, then I use VsCode (with Vim key bindings).
