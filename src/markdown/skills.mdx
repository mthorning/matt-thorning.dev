# Skills

I thought it would be a good idea to list some of the technologies I use here. Although I don't want this page to just be a list of languages and frameworks, so with that in mind, I will try to qualify the listed items with some sort of explanation of how I use them or links to code or blog posts I have written.

## Languages

Although the only language I use for work is Javascript, I have dabbled in other languages in my spare time. Unfortunately, as I haven't needed to use them daily I have probably forgotten 90% of what I knew. I like to think that I could get that knowledge back reasonably quickly should I need to though!

As stated above, this is the language I use daily for my job and therefore the one I know best. It's also the language which I have written the most blog post about.

<TitledSection title="Rust" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust" blogs="http://localhost:8000/blog/?tag=rust" >
I really like Rust but it's quite a steep learning curve coming from JavaScript and I haven't written anything in it for a while so I expect I'm quite rusty (or not rusty depending on how you want to look at it). I wrote a CLI tool for listing the currently installed packages in JavaScript repos which I use daily and I have every intention of getting back into it soon.

<TitledSection title="Reason" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=reason" blogs="http://localhost:8000/blog/?tag=reason" >
Reason is OCaml but with a syntax which is very similar to JavaScript. You can also use React with it which is really cool. Unfortunately unless I start working somewhere which uses it I can't see myself getting back into it as the projects which I could do in Reason would be easier and quicker for me to write in JavaScript using either Svelte or React. I do really like it though.

<TitledSection title="Typescript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=typescript">
Typescript sits somewhere between JavaScript and Reason for me. I haven't used it extensively but I do use it in my [photography website](https://github.com/mthorning/mattthorningphotography) which uses Svelte and I find being able to create interfaces to describe data structures for code completion really useful.
