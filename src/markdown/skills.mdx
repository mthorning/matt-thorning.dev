# Skills

I thought it would be a good idea to list some of the technologies I use here. Although I don't want this page to just be a list of languages and frameworks, so with that in mind, I will try to qualify the listed items with some sort of explanation of how I use them or links to code or blog posts I have written and limit the items here to just the ones which are significant to me.

## Languages

Although the only language I use for work is JavaScript, I have developed with  other languages in my spare time because I find that learning the concepts from other languages helps me write better JavaScript, plus it's fun!

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiJavascript} title="JavaScript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=javascript" blogs="/blog?tag=javascript" >
As stated above, this is the language I use daily for my job and therefore the one I know best. It's also the language which I have written the most blog posts about. In addition to building frontend applications, I have also written web servers and CLI tools with JavaScript.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiRust} title="Rust" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust" blogs="/blog?tag=rust" >
I enjoyed learning Rust which was quite a steep learning curve coming from JavaScript. Aside from working my way through the official book I wrote a couple of CRUD APIs and a CLI tool for listing the currently installed packages in JavaScript repositories which I use pretty much every day.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiReason} title="Reason" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=reason" blogs="/blog?tag=reason" >
After learning Rust I found Reason which allowed me to write frontend applications in React with a language which is syntactically similar to JavaScript but with a solid type system. I enjoyed using it but the trade-off was that the additional complexity introduced through the need to bind to JavaScript modules did make development slower than writing in plain JavaScript. For this reason I can't see myself using it much in the future unless I end up using it in my day job.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiTypescript} title="Typescript" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=typescript">
Typescript sits somewhere between JavaScript and Reason for me. I haven't used it extensively but I do use it in my [photography website](https://github.com/mthorning/mattthorningphotography) (which uses Svelte) where I found that being able to create interfaces to describe data structures for code completion really useful in modules which passed a lot of data around.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiGo} title="Go" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=public&language=go">
I haven't spent a great deal of time with Go but so far I have built a Graphql server to serve the list of blog posts on this site and I am also currently writing a simple SSO server which will allow me to add authentication to any sites I build in the future through the use of JSON Web Tokens.

## Frameworks
I'm going to use the term "frameworks" loosely here, basically I'm classing it as any tool I use with JavaScript to create applications.

<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiReact} title="React" blogs="/blog?tag=react">
This is the main framework I use in my day job. I do enjoy using it, more so since the release of hooks as they have allowed me to write much more functional code which I prefer to using classes. I've written several blog posts on it but I don't have that many examples in Github; I prefer to try other tools in my spare time as I use React all day at work, the only exception being this site.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiSvelte} title="Svelte" github="https://github.com/mthorning?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=svelte">
Svelte is probably my favourite JavaScript framework, I use it with Sapper which provides routing and server-side rendering. Github has classed it as a language which is why I'm able to provide a link to some repositories above. If I had to create a website quickly I would definitely use Svelte.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiGatsby} title="Gatsby" github="https://github.com/mthorning/matt-thorning.dev">
Gatsby is a framework built around React. It's main party trick is that it has a data layer which you can query at build time with GraphQL to create pages dynamically. This site runs on Gatsby so I've included a link to the code in Github above. 
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={SiNodedotjs} title="Node" blogs="/blog?tag=backend&tag=javascript" github="https://github.com/mthorning/weather-report">
I've used Node for writing web servers and also for creating scripts which perform tasks such as cloning multiple repositories or scraping data from websites. I've included a link above to a project which sends me a weather report each night as an example.
</TitledSection>
<TitledSection collapsible Icon={DiBackbone} title="Backbone">
No links for this one and Backbone isn't something I would like to go back to using when we now have the likes of React and Svelte but it was the main framework we used when I started my job so I do have experience with it and therefore it's going on the list!

## Additional
<TitledSection collapsible title ="Test Frameworks" github="https://github.com/mthorning/mattthorningphotography" blogs="/blog?tag=backend&tag=testing">
I've used Mocha, Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library and Cypress. My preference is to use Jest with React Testing Library for unit tests and Cypress for integration tests. I mainly write tests for the code I write at work although I have also written tests with Cypress for my photography website which can be viewed on Github (link above).

<TitledSection collapsible title="Production Environment" blogs="/blog?tag=linux&tag=tooling">
I use CI/CD tools for releasing my code. At work this is with Jenkins and Gitlab Workflows, my own projects use Netlify, Github Actions or (in their infancy) bash scripts. I usually use Docker and Docker Compose for serving applications or for running JavaScript scripts as executables and NGINX for proxying incoming requests to the correct ports for services.
</TitledSection>

<TitledSection collapsible title="Development Environment" blogs="/blog?tag=linux&tag=tooling">
I've used macOS and Windows (with WSL2) in the past but I'm currently using Ubunutu for development, both at home and at work, although I have had to keep an installation of Windows purely for Photoshop. I use i3 window manager with Zsh, Tmux and Neovim which allows me complete control of the configuration of my environment.
