# About

Hello, my name is Matt and I'm a Software Developer. I live in Cornwall which is in the South West of England, with my partner, daughter and cat. <svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M290.59 192c-20.18 0-106.82 1.98-162.59 85.95V192c0-52.94-43.06-96-96-96-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32s14.33 32 32 32c17.64 0 32 14.36 32 32v256c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64h176c8.84 0 16-7.16 16-16v-16c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32h-32l128-96v144c0 8.84 7.16 16 16 16h32c8.84 0 16-7.16 16-16V289.86c-10.29 2.67-20.89 4.54-32 4.54-61.81 0-113.52-44.05-125.41-102.4zM448 96h-64l-64-64v134.4c0 53.02 42.98 96 96 96s96-42.98 96-96V32l-64 64zm-72 80c-8.84 0-16-7.16-16-16s7.16-16 16-16 16 7.16 16 16-7.16 16-16 16zm80 0c-8.84 0-16-7.16-16-16s7.16-16 16-16 16 7.16 16 16-7.16 16-16 16z"></path></svg>

I have a passion for learning and spend a lot of my time coding. I also enjoy listening to music, occasionally play the guitar and like to explore my local area with my camera (you can see some of my photos [here](https://mattthorningphotography.com)).

I've always enjoyed tinkering about with computers and had made a couple of forays into programming in the years before I started learning web development for real. Since then I have always had a couple of projects on the go and feel grateful that I am now able to do what I love for a living.

Although JavaScript is my main language, I have also developed an affection for languages with strong type systems, in particular Rust and Reason. In a similar way to the above, I have found that there are many lessons we can learn as JavaScript developers from using other languages, particularly those which operate at a lower level than JS. Through my use of these and React I have developed a love of functional programming paradigms, and I now look for opportunities to use these lessons to make the software I am developing as composable and robust as possible.
