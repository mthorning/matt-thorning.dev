# About

Hello, my name is Matt and I'm a Software Developer. I live in Cornwall which is in the South West of England, with my partner, daughter and cat. <svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M290.59 192c-20.18 0-106.82 1.98-162.59 85.95V192c0-52.94-43.06-96-96-96-17.67 0-32 14.33-32 32s14.33 32 32 32c17.64 0 32 14.36 32 32v256c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64h176c8.84 0 16-7.16 16-16v-16c0-17.67-14.33-32-32-32h-32l128-96v144c0 8.84 7.16 16 16 16h32c8.84 0 16-7.16 16-16V289.86c-10.29 2.67-20.89 4.54-32 4.54-61.81 0-113.52-44.05-125.41-102.4zM448 96h-64l-64-64v134.4c0 53.02 42.98 96 96 96s96-42.98 96-96V32l-64 64zm-72 80c-8.84 0-16-7.16-16-16s7.16-16 16-16 16 7.16 16 16-7.16 16-16 16zm80 0c-8.84 0-16-7.16-16-16s7.16-16 16-16 16 7.16 16 16-7.16 16-16 16z"></path></svg>

I have a passion for learning and spend most of my time coding and writing blog posts about coding. I also enjoy listening to music, occasionally play the guitar and like to spend time on the coast.

I've worked as a Software Developer since late 2017, before this I was a manager at Royal Mail. I'm self-taught (by that I mean I was taught by other people online!) which has enabled me to learn at a much faster pace than would otherwise have been possible at college or university. By allowing myself to choose my own curriculum and rate of study I have created a desire within myself for learning which has not decreased even after achieving my goal of becoming a Software Developer.

I have been surprised to find that the skills that I gained in my previous roles at Royal Mail transfer easily into Software Development. I value good processes and have found that there are many similarities between the work I did with World Class Mail (similar to Lean Manufacturing) and the Agile methodologies which we follow at Headforwards. Also, the ability to collaborate and act as a member of a team, sometimes taking the lead and sometimes following the lead of others, is important both when moving large volumes of mail to strict deadlines and when developing complex web applications.

Although JavaScript is my main language, I have also developed an affection for languages with strong type systems, in particular Rust and Reason. In a similar way to the above, I have found that there are many lessons we can learn as JavaScript developers from using other languages, particularly those which operate at a lower level than JS. Through my use of these and React (which was originally written in StandardML) I have developed a love of functional programming paradigms, and I now look for opportunities to use these lessons to make the software I am developing as composable and robust as possible.
