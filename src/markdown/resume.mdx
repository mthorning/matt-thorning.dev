# Resume

I have been a JavaScript developer at Headforwards since October 2017 working on products for a large multi-national telecommunications company.

Building an administration portal for customers and providers of datacenter services to enable them to effectively manage their visitors, deliveries and facilities. When I joined the team they were working on a single page application for their customer portal written in Backbone. We started to work on a portal for datacenter providers and decided to use React instead to speed up development. It went so well that we soon decided to port the customer portal over to React too by reusing components.
