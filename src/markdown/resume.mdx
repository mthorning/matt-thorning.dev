# Resume

I have been a JavaScript developer at Headforwards since October 2017, working on software for a large multi-national telecommunications company. I'm self-taught which has enabled me to learn at a much faster pace than would otherwise have been possible at college or university and by allowing myself to choose my own curriculum and rate of study I have created a desire within myself for learning which has not decreased even after achieving my goal of becoming a Software Developer.

Before becoming a developer I was employed as a Work Area Manager at Royal Mail where I was involved in their programme of Continuous Improvement (World Class Mail) which has its roots in [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing). I have been surprised to find that the skills that I gained in my previous roles at Royal Mail transfer easily into Software Development. I value good processes and have found that there are many similarities between the work I did with World Class Mail and the Agile methodologies which we follow at Headforwards. Also, the ability to collaborate and act as a member of a team, sometimes taking the lead and sometimes following the lead of others, is important both when moving large volumes of mail to strict deadlines and when developing complex web applications.
