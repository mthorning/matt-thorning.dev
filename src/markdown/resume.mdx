# Resume

I have been a JavaScript developer at Headforwards since October 2017 working on software for a large multi-national telecommunications company. I'm self-taught which has enabled me to learn at a much faster pace than would otherwise have been possible at college or university and by allowing myself to choose my own curriculum and rate of study I have created a desire within myself for learning which has not decreased even after achieving my goal of becoming a Software Developer.

Before becoming a developer I was employed as a Work Area Manager at Royal Mail where I was involved in their programme of Continuous Improvement (World Class Mail) which has its roots in [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing). I have been surprised to find that the skills that I gained in my previous roles at Royal Mail transfer easily into Software Development. I value good processes and have found that there are many similarities between the work I did with World Class Mail and the Agile methodologies which we follow at Headforwards. Also, the ability to collaborate and act as a member of a team, sometimes taking the lead and sometimes following the lead of others, is important both when moving large volumes of mail to strict deadlines and when developing complex web applications.

Although JavaScript is my main language, I have also developed an affection for languages with strong type systems, in particular Rust and Reason. In a similar way to the above, I have found that there are many lessons we can learn as JavaScript developers from using other languages, particularly those which operate at a lower level than JS. Through my use of these and React I have developed a love of functional programming paradigms, and I now look for opportunities to use these lessons to make the software I am developing as composable and robust as possible.
