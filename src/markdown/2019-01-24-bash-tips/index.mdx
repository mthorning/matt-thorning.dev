This post is as much for myself as it is for anyone else and I will update it whenever I come across anything that I find that is worth including. The below are all of the cool little bash commands for linux/unix that I have stumbled across.

Command | Description
------- | :-----------|
`man`   | Follow this with any command for full instructions on how to use. Most commands can be followed with `--help` or `-h` as well for a reminder of the basics.
`set -e` | Sets option to exit a script if a command returns a non-zero exit code.
`set -x` | Outputs the commands that get run as they run.
`grep` | Searches an input and prints out lines that match a pattern.
`<()` | Treats output as a file such as `diff <(grep something) <(grep nothing)`.
`!!` | Repeats the last command.
`!$` | Repeats the last argument of the last command.
`pushd` | Changes directory like `cd` but adds to stack so you can then go back with `popd`.
`cd ~` | Change to home directory, `cd` on its own will also do this.
`cd -` | Go back to previous directory.
`!:1-$` | Takes all the arguments to the previous command and drops them in. `!`(last command) `:1`(first word) `-$`(to last word).
`:h` | Put it after a filename, and it will change that filename to remove everything up to the folder.
`exit 0` | Exit script with exit code zero.
`head` | Print first 5 lines of file.txt.
`tail`  | Print last 5 lines of file.txt.
`lsof` | Lists open files. Use with `-i :80` to find process listening on a port (port 80 here).
`netstat` | Lists network processes. If used with `-plt` switch it shows port numbers with programme name and PID. Useful if there is a process already listening on a port which you want to use.
`ctrl-r` | Reverse history search. `Ctrl-r` next item, `ctrl-j` to copy or `enter` to run.
`top` | Live feed of processes using memory and how much memory they are using.
`htop` | Like top but with a graphical interface.
`tee` | Splits the output of a program so that it can be both displayed on screen and saved in a file.

## Variables
```
$ variable=$(git describe --tags)
$ echo "version is $variable"
version is 0.15.0
```
<br />

## Here Docs
Input stream which sends the text in each line to a process until a line is reached which contains only the delimiter (`ENDOFSTRING` in the example below).
```
$ cat << ENDOFSTRING
  This is a here doc
  It will write every line to the file
  until a line with only ENDOFSTRING
  ENDOFSTRING

This is a here doc
It will write every line to the file
until a line with on ENDOFSTRING
```
<br />

## Translate
Transforms or deletes characters in a string.
```
$ echo "hello there" | tr a-z A-Z
HELLO THERE

$ echo "edward woodward" | tr -d "d"
ewar woowar
```

As mentioned above, I will keep updating this one. I expect I'll update the date each time to keep bumping it up the list. I'm also planning on starting a similar reference list of Vim commands :)
<br />

## Cat
Concatenates files. In addition to writing a file to stdout, `cat` can also write to a file. Use cat with redirect ( `>` ) to the file you want to write to, write your message then `ctrl-d` to exit:
```
$cat > file1.txt
Hello from file 2

$cat > file2.txt
Hello from file 2

cat file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt
cat file3.txt
Hello from file 2
Hello from file 2
```
<br />

## Links
Creates a hard link to a file in another location. Use the `-s` switch to make it a soft link (also called a symbolic link or symlink for short) to a file in another location:
```
ln -s target_path link_path
```
The files that you see on your filesystem are just pointers to something called an _inode_ which is where the data is actually stored internally. A hard link is another pointer which points to the same inode. A soft link creates a new inode which references the original inode. This is an important distinction to make because deleting a hard link will delete the actual inode whereas deleting a soft link (symlink) does not affect the original file.

## Tar
Compresses a directory or files(s).
```
tar -czvf name-of-archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory-or-file
```
The `c` switch signifies we want to create an archive, `z` says we want to use gzip to compress the file(s), `v` is verbose and `f` indicates that the following text will be the name of the filename we want to create. To unzip a tarball it is the same syntax as above except the `c` (create) switch is replaced with `x` for _extract_:
```
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz
```
<br />

## SSH
Securely connect to a remote host.
```
ssh your_username@remote_host_domain_or_ip_address
```
<br />

## SCP
Secure copy files from remote host to local host or vice-versa. It uses [SSH](bash-tips#ssh) with the same level of security to transfer the files.
```
scp foobar.txt your_username@remotehost:/some/remote/directory
```
Reverse the order of the arguments to copy in the other direction.

## Find
Recursively searches directories to find files.
```
find /start/dir -name "something.*"
```
